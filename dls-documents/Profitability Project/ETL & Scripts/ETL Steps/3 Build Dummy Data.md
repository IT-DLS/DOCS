For the purposes of reporting we need to see all customers with any values within the timeframe of year to date and previous year to date at any given monthly report. This will not occur if no activity happens for a given customer during a given month since the record count will be null for that range criteria. To solve this we use the dummy script which does the following:

1. **Import Necessary Libraries**: The script imports various libraries including SQLAlchemy, datetime, psycopg2, pandas, wakepy, and warnings.
    
2. **Suppress Warnings**: Warnings are temporarily ignored.
    
3. **Define the Function `createdummykeys`**:
    
    - **Define SQL Queries**: Two SQL queries are created to pull data from the `df_sales_profitability` table.
    - **Connect to Database and Execute Queries**: Connect to a PostgreSQL database and execute the SQL queries, storing the results in two dataframes (`df` and `df2`).
    - **Create Dictionary from Dataframe**: Convert `df2` into a dictionary (`df_dict`) with keys formed from concatenated column values.
    - **Process Dates**: Extract and format month start dates from `df`, and create a dictionary (`key_date_dic`) to map keys to dates.
    - **Generate Date Range**: Determine the start and end dates from the data and generate a range of monthly dates between these dates.
    - **Build Dummy Keys**: For each month in the date range, check if the key exists in `key_date_dic`. If not, add it to a list of dummy keys.
    - **Extract Data for Dummy Records**: Extract customer, part, product_line, location, and date_record values from dummy keys and store them in lists.
    - **Create Dataframe**: Build a dataframe (`dummyDF`) from these lists and initialize additional columns (`revenue`, `std_cost`, `mfg_var`, `p18adj`) to 0.
    - **Insert Dummy Records**: If the dataframe contains records, insert them into the `df_sales_profitability` table in the database and print the number of records inserted. If the dataframe is empty, print a message indicating no records were built.
4. **Call the Function `createdummykeys`**: Execute the function to perform the above steps.
    
5. **Restore Warnings**: Restore default warning behavior.
